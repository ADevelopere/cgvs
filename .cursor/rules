# Cursor IDE Rules for Bun Package Manager

## Package Manager Configuration
- Always use Bun as the package manager instead of npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Use the specific Bun binary path: ~/.bun/bin/bun
- When installing packages, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun install
- When adding packages, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun add <package-name>
- When removing packages, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun remove <package-name>
- When running scripts, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun run <script-name>
- When executing files directly, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun <file-path>

## Scripts and Commands
- Prefer Bun's built-in commands over npm equivalents
- Use `~/.bun/bin/bun create` for scaffolding new projects
- Use `~/.bun/bin/bun test` for running tests
- Use `~/.bun/bin/bun build` for building projects

## File Operations
- When creating package.json files, ensure they're compatible with Bun
- When suggesting package installations, always use Bun syntax
- When providing terminal commands, use the full path to Bun binary

## Development Workflow
- Always assume Bun is the preferred runtime and package manager
- Suggest Bun-specific optimizations and features when relevant
- Use Bun's faster installation and execution capabilities
